# MNIST-Convolutional-Neural-Network With a Graphical User Interface
A Convolutional Neural Network that predicts what digit is drawn in a box
To use, run drawingRecognizer.py. Make sure you are using python3 and have the following dependencies installed:
TensorFlow, Pillow, opencv, and anything else I might have missed. If you want to train the network again, you can either run trainModel.py or you can reload the trainingData by running loadData.py but you must unzip the training data file in order for it to be accsessible first (make sure you change the directory of the images of course)

# MNIST-Convolutional-Neural-Network
A Convolutional Neural Network that predicts what digit is drawn in a box
To use, run drawingRecognizer.py. Make sure you are using python3 and have the following dependencies installed:
TensorFlow, Pillow, opencv, and anything else I might have missed. If you want to train the network again, you can either run trainModel.py or you can reload the trainingData by running loadData.py first (make sure you change the directory of the images of course)
